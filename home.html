            March is an unpredictable month: one day can be as cold as any in winter, the next as warm as any in spring. It may be as dry as a desert one morning and, by sundown , as wet as a monsoon night. Fresh falls of snow in the mountains of Kashmir of Himachal bring chilly winds to the capital. Strong winds push clouds up to freezing heights, convert raindrops into ice, toss icelets up over and over again till they are too heavy to bear and let them descend on the Earth as hail. Lets read more about this amazing and unpredictable month.

            <h1 id="topic2">History</h1>
            <p>March is named after  <i>Martius</i>, the first month in the old Roman calendar. It was also named after Mars, the Roman god of war and an ancestor of Roman people through his sons Romulus and Remus.
            The month <i>Martius</i> was the beginning of the season of warfare.</p>
            <p>March 1<sup>st</sup> was also marked as the beginning of the numbered year in Russia until the 15<sup>th</sup> century. Even today, many other cultures like Iran, Ethiopia, still celebrate the beginning of the New Year in March. March is the first month of spring in the Northern Hemisphere (North America, Europe, Asia and part of Africa) and the first month of fall or autumn in the Southern Hemisphere (South America, part of Africa, and Oceania).</p>

        <p><h1 id="topic3">Seasons</h1>
        <p>In the Northern Hemisphere, March is seen as a part of the spring season, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere, it is seen as a part of Autumn. The Indian Meteorological Department also considers March as a part of the summer or pre-monsoon season. Lets dive deep into the seasons of March.<p><h3>In the Northern Hemisphere</h3><p style="padding-left: 20px;"> March marks the beginning of spring, characterized by warmer temperatures, melting snow, and the sprouting of new vegetation. It's also when the vernal equinox occurs, usually around March 20th or 21st, leading to roughly equal day and night hours. </p></p><p><h3>In the Southern Hemisphere</h3><p style="padding-left: 20px;"> In contrast, March in the Southern Hemisphere is the beginning of autumn, with leaves changing colors and temperatures starting to cool down.  </p></p></p>
        <p><h3>In India</h3><p style="padding-left: 20px;"> The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) classifies March as part of the summer or pre-monsoon season, which runs from March to May. However, in the traditional Hindu calendar, March is also considered part of the spring season (Vasant). </p></p></p>
